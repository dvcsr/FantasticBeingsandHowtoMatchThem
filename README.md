This is the *Fantastic Beings and How to Match Them* project I made myself.


<p>A mysterious man appeared in New York with a strange suitcase. The next day, the city was filled with strange beings of all sorts. A funny coincidence, isn't it? Creatures are magical; you can't get rid of them with ordinary spells. That's why you have a mission to collect all the creatures back into the suitcase! Create a classic match-three game based on the magical universe to save humanity from these fantastic (and very cute) beings.</p><br/>
