In this project, I managed to successfully implement:
- Create a playing board, add all necessary elements to HTML, and decorate them with CSS.
- Add some JS to the game and make map generate automatically.
- Add creatures on the map. implement random.
- Cast the spell to match the creatures using the magic cursor. Make the creatures disappear and redraw the map after matching.
- Make new creatures should appear on the map immediately after the old ones disappear.
- Count the points earned and decide who won and who lost.
- Decorate the game with animations and sounds.
